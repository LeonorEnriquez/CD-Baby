Except as otherwise set forth in an Addendum, you will have the discretion to set the pricing for the sale of Your Content on the Website. Notwithstanding the foregoing, CD Baby and its distributors and partners may set pricing differently for third-party websites than for the Website, including, by way of example and not limitation, to cover additional costs or to provide discounts for promotions. CD Baby reserves the sole and exclusive right to set the pricing for any digital audio transmissions of Your Content, whether on an interactive or noninteractive basis, provided that Your Content will be priced the same as all other content on the Service licensed by CD Baby for interactive or noninteractive digital audio transmissions. You will also be subject to additional set up fees and charges as more fully explained on the Website, including, but not limited to, fees for CD Baby’s administering mechanical royalties for the reproduction and distribution of musical works (as applicable), as such fees and charges may be updated by CD Baby from time to time, and you are responsible for reviewing those fees and charges. Your acceptance of this Agreement is an acceptance of the CD Baby fees and charges, which are available here:</span><a href="https://cdbaby.com/cd-baby-cost/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">https://cdbaby.com/cd-baby-cost/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>(b) </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Licensee Records. CD Baby, may, but need not, audit the books and records of Licensees and may accept any representations made in a Licensee accounting statement delivered to CD Baby as true and complete. CD Baby shall have no liability to you for failure to audit or investigate any accountings rendered to it by any Licensees.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>(c) </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Offsets. You hereby authorize CD Baby to offset against any amounts owed to you pursuant to this Agreement any amounts that you may owe to CD Baby, whether under an indemnification provision or for costs, expenses, taxes, and deductions authorized in this Agreement.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>(d) </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recordkeeping; Audits. We will maintain books and records which report the sale or other licensed uses of Your Content. You may, but not more than once a year, at your own expense, engage a Certified Public Accountant (“CPA”) to examine those books and records directly related to the sale or other licensed uses of Your Content, as provided in this Section 4(d), only. You may have your CPA make those examinations only for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of the statements sent to you. All such examinations will be in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) procedures and regulations. Your CPA may make such an examination for a particular statement only once, and only within one (1) year after the date we send you that statement. Your CPA may make such an examination only during our usual business hours, and only at the place where such books and records are maintained in the ordinary course of business. You must provide us with thirty (30)-days written notice prior to commencing an audit and must identify the name, address, telephone number, and email address of the CPA conducting the audit on your behalf. You may not engage the CPA on a contingent fee basis (i.e., your CPA must be paid on a flat fee or time-based basis). We may postpone the commencement of your CPA’s examination by notice given to you not later than five (5) days before the commencement date specified in your notice. In the event of any postponement initiated by us, the running of the time within which the examination may be made will be suspended during the postponement. If your CPA’s examination has not been completed within three (3) months from the time commenced, then we may require you to terminate the audit upon seven (7) days’ notice, which notice may be given at any time. We will not be required to permit the CPA to continue any examination after the end of that seven (7) day period. Your CPA will not be entitled to examine any other records that do not specifically report sales or other licensed uses of Your Content for which CD Baby has actually received payment. Your CPA may act only under an acceptable confidentiality agreement, which provides that any information derived from such audit or examination on your behalf will not be knowingly released, divulged, published, or shared with any other person, firm, or corporation, other than to you or to a judicial or administrative body in connection with any proceeding relating to this Agreement. Your CPA may not share the results of the examination conducted on your behalf with any third party without our express written permission.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>(e) </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Objections to Accountings. If you have any objections to a CD Baby accounting statement made available to you, you agree that you shall give us specific notice of that objection, including a copy of your CPA’s analysis of the accounting statement, and your reasons for it within eighteen (18) months after the date we send or make that statement available to you. Each statement shall become conclusively binding on you at the end of that eighteen (18) month period, and you will no longer have any right to make any other objections to it notwithstanding any audit rights you may otherwise have under any applicable law or regulation. Any payments determined to be owed you following an audit shall be paid within forty-five (45) days of the delivery of your CPA’s audit report, unless objected to in writing by CD Baby, in which case any payments due shall be postponed pending the resolution of the audit dispute. A late fee of one-half percent (0.5%) shall be due for underpaid royalties. Unless otherwise prohibited by law, you will not have the right to sue us in connection with any statement, or to sue us for unpaid royalties for the period a statement covers, unless you commence the suit within that eighteen (18)-month period. If you commence suit on any controversy or claim concerning statements rendered to you under this Agreement in a court of competent jurisdiction, the scope of the proceeding will be limited to a determination of the amount of royalties due for the accounting periods concerned, and the court shall have no authority to consider any other issues or award any relief except recovery of any royalties found owing, plus interest at the rate of one-half percent (0.5%) per month. Your recovery of any such royalties plus interest shall be the sole remedy available to you by reason of any claim related to our statements.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>(f) </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Affiliation with Other Performing Rights Organizations for Royalties. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit you from affiliating with any PRO for the receipt of royalty payments for the public performance or communication to the public of your sound recordings or musical works made by a third party, excluding only public performances or communications to the public of sound recordings or musical works made by CD Baby pursuant to the Authorizations set forth in Section 2 of this Agreement.</span></li>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><b>(i) </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">CD Baby’s payment of any sums to you hereunder, including any royalties for your Content licensed pursuant to this Agreement, is conditioned upon your fulfillment of all obligations described hereunder and CD Baby’s receipt of your completed U.S. Federal Tax form W-9 or, as applicable, the appropriate form W-8,</span></li>

Although CD Baby reserves the right to take any actions available to it in any dispute with a Licensee, nothing in this Agreement or any applicable Addenda obligates CD Baby to collect any amounts due it by a Licensee or initiate any cause of action against a Licensee for nonpayment of any CD Baby Artist Royalties. All accountings rendered and payments made by CD Baby to you shall be binding upon you and not subject to any objection for any reason unless specific objection in writing, stating the basis thereof is given to CD Baby within one (1) year from the date rendered.

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>(b) </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE PURSUANT TO APPLICABLE LAW, CD BABY AND ITS AFFILIATES, PARTNERS, LICENSORS AND SUPPLIERS HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL EXPRESS, IMPLIED AND STATUTORY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NONINFRINGEMENT. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM CD BABY OR THROUGH THE WEBSITE WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY STATED HEREIN.

<h2><b>19. DISPUTE RESOLUTION:</b></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>(a) </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mandatory Arbitration. Please read this carefully. It affects your rights. YOU AND CD BABY AND EACH OF OUR RESPECTIVE SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, PREDECESSORS IN INTEREST, SUCCESSORS, AND PERMITTED ASSIGNS AGREE TO ARBITRATION (EXCEPT FOR MATTERS THAT MAY BE TAKEN TO SMALL CLAIMS COURT), AS THE EXCLUSIVE FORM OF DISPUTE RESOLUTION EXCEPT AS PROVIDED FOR BELOW, FOR ALL DISPUTES AND CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Please visit www.adr.org for more information about arbitration.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>(b) </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commencing Arbitration. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written notice of intent to arbitrate (a “Notice”), or, in the absence of a mailing address provided by you to CD Baby, to you via any other method available to CD Baby, including via email. The Notice to CD Baby should be addressed to: [CD Baby / ATTN: Legal / 9600 NE Cascades Parkway Suite 180 / Portland, OR / 97220] (the “Arbitration Notice Address”). The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought (the “Demand”). If you and CD Baby do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or CD Baby may commence an arbitration proceeding as set forth below or file a claim in small claims court. THE ARBITRATION SHALL BE ADMINISTERED BY THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION (“AAA”) IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION RULES AND THE SUPPLEMENTARY PROCEDURES FOR CONSUMER RELATED DISPUTES (THE “Rules”), AS MODIFIED BY THIS AGREEMENT. The Rules and AAA forms are available online at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by writing to the Notice Address. If you are required to pay a filing fee to commence an arbitration against CD Baby, then CD Baby will promptly reimburse you for your confirmed payment of the filing fee upon CD Baby receipt of Notice at the Arbitration Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration along with a receipt evidencing payment of the filing fee, unless your Demand is equal to or greater than US$1,000, in which case you are solely responsible for the payment of the filing fee.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>(c) </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arbitration Proceeding. The arbitration shall be conducted in the English language. A single independent and impartial arbitrator shall be appointed pursuant to the Rules, as modified herein. You and CD Baby agree to comply with the following rules, which are intended to streamline the dispute resolution process and reduce the costs and burdens on the parties:</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><b>(i) </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based on written submissions, the specific manner to be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><b>(ii) </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">the arbitration shall not require any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing by the parties; and</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><b>(iii) </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>(d) </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">No Class Actions. YOU AND CD BABY AGREE THAT YOU AND CD BABY MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. FURTHER, YOU AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE PROCEEDINGS OF MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING, AND THAT IF THIS SPECIFIC PROVISO IS FOUND TO BE UNENFORCEABLE, THEN THE ENTIRETY OF THIS MANDATORY ARBITRATION SECTION SHALL BE NULL AND VOID.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>(e) </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decision of the Arbitrator. Barring extraordinary circumstances, the arbitrator shall issue his or her decision within 120 days from the date the arbitrator is appointed. The arbitrator may extend this time limit for an additional 30 days in the interests of justice. All arbitration proceedings shall be closed to the public and confidential and all records relating thereto shall be permanently sealed, except as necessary to obtain court confirmation of the arbitration award. The award of the arbitrator shall be in writing and shall include a statement setting forth the reasons for the disposition of any claim. The arbitrator shall apply the laws of the State of Oregon in conducting the arbitration. You acknowledge that this Agreement and your use of the Services and the Website evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce. The United States Federal Arbitration Act shall govern the interpretation, enforcement, and proceedings pursuant to the Mandatory Arbitration clause in this Agreement.</span></li>
